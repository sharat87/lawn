This is a repo of all my configuration files, predominantly of Vim and Tmux applications. There's stuff in here that's
quite old and that I don't use as often as I used to. I may take the time to clean up some day.

You should NOT be cloning this repo on your laptop and expect it to just work. The expectation of *just works* can vary
wildly from person to person when it comes to configuration; and there's a *lot* of configuration here.

The idea of this repo is twofold:

1. Serve as a backup of my configuration, along with all its history.
1. A friend of mine wanted to see and follow my Vim config, so here it is.
